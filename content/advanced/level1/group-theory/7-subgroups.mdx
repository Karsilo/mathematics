A subgroup is a group that sits inside a larger group, using the same operation

Let $G$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$

Then $H$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ if $H$ is itself a group under the same operation

## Key Points

**Associativity** is automatic if $\cdot$ is associative in $G$

The other **Composition Rules** must hold within $H$ for $H$ to be considered a group

Any subset of a group that satisfies closure, contains the identity, and contains inverses is a subgroup

### Example 1

**Integers ($\Z$)**

$\Z$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$ under addition


### Example 2

**Circle Group**

$$
S^1 = \{z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| = 1\}
$$

is a subgroup of the non-zero complex numbers $\mathbb{C}^*$ under multiplication


### Example 3

**Rotations of a Triangle**

$$
\{Id, r, r^2\}
$$

the rotations in $D_3$, form a subgroup of the dihedral group of the triangle
