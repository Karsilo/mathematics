### Group
A collection of "things" (numbers, functions, vectors, symmetries, etc)

For a set to be considered a Group, it must satisfy all of the composition rules.

&nbsp;

### Composition Rules

A group $G$ is a set of elements $\{x, y, z, ...\}$ together with an operation $\cdot$ that satisfies the following properties

- **Closure** - For any $x, y \in G,$ the product $(x \cdot y) \in G$
- **Associativity** - For all elements in $G$, $(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z) $
- **Identity** - There exists an element $e \in G$ such that $e \cdot x = x \cdot e = x$ for every $x \in G$
- **Inverse** - For each $x \in G$, there exists an element $x^{-1} \in G$ such that $x^{-1} \cdot x = x \cdot x^{-1} = e$

we will be written $e$ as $Id$ from now on

&nbsp;

### Abelian Group

If two elements $x, y \in G$ are cummutative such that

$$
x \cdot y = y \cdot x
$$

then the group is said to be **abelian**


#### Examples

- The groups $\mathbb{Z}, \; \mathbb{Q}, \; \mathbb{R}, \; \mathbb{C}$ with addition are cummutative

- The groups $\mathbb{R}^*, \; \mathbb{C}^*$ are commutitive with multiplication

The $(^*)$ indicates all non-zero elements, since $0$ doesn't not have a multiplicative inverse so it would not satisfy the **Inverse** composition rule
