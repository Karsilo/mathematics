A complex function can be written as

$$
f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)
$$

where
- $z = x + bi$
- $u(x, y) = $ real part
- $iv(x, y) = $ imaginary part

since $f(z)$ codomain is $\R^2$ we can write $f(z)$ as an associated function

$$
\tilde{f}: \R^2 \to \R^2 \\
\; \\
\tilde{f}(x, y) = (u(x, y), v(x, y))
$$

## Complex Differentiable

For a real function, derivatives only look left & right

- image

For a complex function, the derivative must be the same no matter which direction you approach from

### Key Idea

If a derivative exists and is direction-independent, then the partial derivatives of $u$ and $v$ must satisfy two special equations (Cauchy-Riemann Equations)

$$
\dfrac{\delta u}{\delta x} = \dfrac{\delta v}{\delta y}, \quad \quad \dfrac{\delta u}{\delta y} = -\dfrac{\delta v}{\delta x}
$$
