# Vectors & Kinematics

This section covers vector mathematics and kinematics - the study of motion.

## Overview

- **Vectors** - Mathematical objects with magnitude and direction
- **Vector Operations** - Addition, scalar multiplication, dot and cross products
- **Kinematics** - Description of motion without considering forces
- **Equations of Motion** - Mathematical relationships for constant acceleration
