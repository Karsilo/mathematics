## Definition

$$
f(x + na) = f(x)
$$

where $a$ is the period and $n \in \N$

A periodic function can be represented as a sum of $\cos$ and $\sin$ functions in the form

$$
f(x) = 1\cdot a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \cos(nx) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n \sin(nx)
$$

&nbsp;

### Example

$f(x) = x$ has a period of $2\pi$
