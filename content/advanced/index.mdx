# Advanced Mathematics

Welcome to Advanced Mathematics. This section covers more complex mathematical concepts and theories organized by difficulty level.

## Level 1

The first level covers foundational advanced topics:

- **Vectors & Kinematics** - Vector operations and motion equations
- **Complex Numbers** - Real and imaginary number systems
- **Limits** - Fundamental concepts in calculus
- **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** - Equations involving derivatives
- **Fourier Series** - Periodic function representation
- **Complex Analysis** - Functions of complex variables
